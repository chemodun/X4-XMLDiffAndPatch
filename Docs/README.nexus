[size=4][u]Modding tools: XML diff and patch for X4: Foundations[/u][/size]

This toolset is a simple XML diff and patch tools for X4: Foundations. It is designed to help modders to compare and patch XML files.

The format of diff XML files is compatible with the appropriate [b]diff.xsd[/b] format definition. It is means - you can you this tool to create diff files for any XML files used in game.
Also, you can use appropriate tool to patch XML files with diff files, this action has reason to check how your diff file will be applied to the vanilla XML file. Or better understand, what other modders did in their mods.

[size=3][u][b]Important note[/b][/u][/size]

It is highly recommended to use the [b]diff.xsd[/b] file to validate the diff XML files. It is especially important when you creating them by [b]XMLDiff.exe[/b].
If the [b]diff.xsd[/b] file if it located in the "current" folder it will be used automatically. If you want to use another [b]diff.xsd[/b] file, you can specify it with the [b]-x[/b] option.

[size=3][u]Path options[/u][/size]

[size=2][u][i]Only full path[/i][/u][/size]

The [b]--only-full-path[/b] option will generate only the full path to the element in the XML file. It is mean - there no [b]//[/b] will be in the [b]sel[/b] attribute of the [b]add[/b], [b]replace[/b] or [b]remove[/b] element.

Example:

[code]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?>

    </ware>
</add>
</diff>
[/code]

[size=2][u][i]Use all attributes in XPath[/i][/u][/size]

The [b]--use-all-attributes[/b] option will generate the [b]sel[/b] attribute with all attributes of the element in the XML file. It is mean - there will be all attributes of the element in the [b]sel[/b] attribute of the [b]add[/b], [b]replace[/b] or [b]remove[/b] element.

Example:

[code]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?>

[size=2][u][i]Ignore differences in the specified attribute[/i][/u][/size]

The [b]--ignore-diff-in-attribute[/b] option will ignore differences in the specified attribute when comparing elements. It is useful when you want to ignore differences in attributes like [b]version[/b], [b]comment[/b], etc.

[size=3][u]Defining the position generation for the diff by in-line comment[/u][/size]

The [b]pos[/b] attribute of the [b]add[/b] usually is set to [b]after[/b], taking in account the common logic of how the program is working. But in some cases, you may want to have a diff file with the [b]pos[/b] attribute set to [b]before[/b]. Mostly it is useful when it working in conjunction with the vscode - [url=https://github.com/chemodun/X4-XMLDiffAndPatch/raw/main//XMLDIffWithVSCode.md]XMLDiff with VSCode[/url].
From version 0.2.26, you can define the position of the [b]add[/b] element in the diff file by using an in-line comment in the original XML file. The comment should be placed before the element you want to add and should contain the text [b]<!-- pos="before" -->[/b].

[size=3][u][i]If output XML is a directory[/i][/u][/size]

If the output XML is a directory, the tool will create a new XML file with the same name as the original XML file in the output directory.
For example, if the original XML file is [b]vanilla.xml[/b] and the output directory is [b]output[/b], the tool will create a new XML file [b]output/vanilla.xml[/b].

[size=3][u][i]How to apply a tools to a directories[/i][/u][/size]

[size=3][u]Applying XMLDiff to directories[/u][/size]

You can apply the XMLDiff tool to directories. In this case, the tool will traverse the directory structure and create diff files for XML files with identical names and relative paths. The process is as follows:
[list]
[*] If all input parameters are directories, the tool will create diff files for all XML files in the directories.
[*] The tool will recursively go through the directory structure, using modified files as a "keys" for it
[*] For each changed file, the corresponding original XML file in the original directory with the same relative path will be checked.
[*] If the original XML file is not found, the operation will be skipped.
[*] If the original XML file is found, the diff file will be created in the output directory with the same relative path.
[/list]
Example:

[code]
XMLDiff.exe -o vanilla_dir -m modified_dir -d diff_dir
[/code]

[size=3][u]Applying XMLPatch to directories[/u][/size]

You can apply the XMLPatch tool to directories. In this case, the tool will traverse the directory structure and apply the patch to XML files with identical names and relative paths. The process is as follows:
[list]
[*] If all input parameters are directories, the tool will apply the patch to all XML files in the directories.
[*] The tool will recursively go through the directory structure, using diff files as a "keys" for it
[*] For each diff file, the corresponding original XML file in the original directory with the same relative path will be checked.
[*] If the original XML file is not found, the operation will be skipped.
[*] If the original XML file is found, the diff file will be patched with the original XML file, and a new patched XML file will be created in the output directory with the same relative path.
[/list]
Example:

[code]
XMLPatch.exe -o vanilla_dir -d diff_dir -u modified_dir
[/code]
